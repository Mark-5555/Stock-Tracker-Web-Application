## Project Name: Stock Tracker
### Project Summary: This project is a web application that pulls structured data from an API, stores it in a database, and allows both API-fetched and manually created entries to be managed through a full interface. Users can register, log in, edit their profiles, and interact with the data by associating specific items to themselves. Admin users have more capabilities, such as assigning entities to multiple users, removing associations, and managing all entities and relationships in the system. The application supports sorting, filtering, and user-friendly messages while following secure coding practices like authentication, authorization, passwords, and role-based permissions.
